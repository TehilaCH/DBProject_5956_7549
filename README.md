# Medical Corps
## Phase 1: Design and Build the Database

### **Introduction**  
The **Medical Corps Database** is designed to efficiently manage information related to paramedics, patients, treatments, medical equipment, hospitals, and medical events.  
This system ensures **structured organization** and tracking of essential details such as patient care, medical procedures, evacuation logistics, and resource management.  

---

### **Purpose of the Database**  
This database serves as a **structured and reliable solution** for the Medical Corps to:  

- **Manage paramedic assignments** by recording their experience and linking them to performed treatments.  
- **Store patient records**, including personal details, medical conditions, and treatment history.  
- **Document medical treatments**, tracking procedure types, durations, and associated personnel.  
- **Monitor medical equipment usage**, ensuring the availability of essential supplies.  
- **Track hospital evacuations**, recording patient transfers and methods of transport.  
- **Log medical events**, documenting incidents, casualty counts, and locations.  

---

### **Potential Use Cases**  
- **Medical Corps Administrators** can oversee paramedic assignments, track patient treatments, and manage medical resources.  
- **Paramedics** can document treatments performed and access relevant medical equipment records.  
- **Hospital Staff** can monitor incoming evacuations, ensuring proper patient admission and care.  
- **Commanders and Emergency Coordinators** can analyze event data to **improve medical response and evacuation efficiency**.  

---

This **structured database** helps streamline **military medical operations**, improving **organization, efficiency, and responsiveness** in both **routine and emergency scenarios**.
